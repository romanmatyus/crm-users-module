# CRM Users Module

[![Translation status @ Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/remp-crm/-/users-module/svg-badge.svg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/remp-crm/users-module/)

This documentation describes API handlers and CLI commands provided by this module for
others to use. It expects your application is based on the [CRM skeleton](https://github.com/remp2020/crm-skeleton)
provided by us.

## Installing module

We recommend using Composer for installation and update management.

```shell
composer require remp/crm-users-module
```

## Enabling module

Add installed extension to your `app/config/config.neon` file.

```neon
extensions:
	users: Crm\UsersModule\DI\UsersModuleExtension
```

## Generate ACL

User access resources are used to control access rights of admin groups in CRM admin. These resources are generated from methods `render*`, `action*`, `handle*` of all presenters extending `Crm\AdminModule\Presenters\AdminPresenter`.

To generate run command:

  ```shell
  php bin/command.php user:generate_access
  ```

This command should be run everytime new version is released to validate & generate new resources.

All new resources are automatically assigned to `superadmin` admin group - check seeder `Crm\UsersModule\Seeders\UsersSeeder`.

Other admin groups are not affected. New resources have to be assigned either manually via admin interface (http://crm.press/users/admin-group-admin/show/1) or seeded within your module.

### ACL - `admin-access-level`

_These annotations are optional and do not affect resolving access rights to resource._

To ease assigning of access rights to admin groups (http://crm.press/users/admin-group-admin/show/1), level of access resource can be specified as method annotation `admin-access-level`. CRM uses now two levels `read` and `write`. Level `write` indicates that this method can be used to create, update or remove entity. Rest of resources has level `read`.

Example:

  ```php
  use Crm\AdminModule\Presenters\AdminPresenter;

  class ExampleAdminPresenter extends AdminPresenter {

      /**
       * @admin-access-level read
       */
      public function renderDefault()
      {
      }

      /**
       * @admin-access-level write
       */
      public function renderEdit()
      {
      }
  }
  ````

If annotation `admin-access-level` is missing, no level is displayed on page where resources/right are assigned to admin groups (http://crm.press/users/admin-group-admin/show/1).

### Cleanup

Command has also cleanup option:

  ```shell
  php bin/command.php user:generate_access --cleanup
  ```

After resources are generated, it will compare current ACL resources and actions with previous state. Orphaned ACL resources will be removed from database. Useful when module is uninstalled or admin presenter / action is removed.

> **WARNING**: This option doesn't fix ACL after resource is moved. That should be handled by module when resource is moved / renamed (eg. by migration).

## Single sign-on

### Google Sign-In

Users module supports Google Sign-In authentication using the Authorization code flow and ID token.

#### Configuration

Any application that uses Google Sign-In must have authorization credentials that identify the application to Google's OAuth 2.0 server.
To set up credentials, please go to Google [Credentials page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).

After acquiring credentials, put them to `neon` configuration file using the following format:
```neon
users:
	sso:
	    google:
	        client_id: CLIENT_ID
	        client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET
```

Last step is to **enable** Google Sign-In in CRM settings in `/admin/config-admin/` Authentication section.

#### ID Token

ID Token is a Google-signed JWT token holding user information (see [the documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/backend-auth)).
This module provides an [API endpoint](#post-apiv1usersgoogle-token-sign-in) to validate the token and match it to an existing user (or create a new one) using user's email address.

#### Authorization code flow

Standard OAuth2 Authorization code flow is initiated when user is redirected to `http://crm.press/users/google/sign` URL.

An optional parameter is `url`, which is a URL to redirect to after the successful login.
`url` is validated against current CRM domain - `url` has to share at least the second level domain, e.g. if your CRM is available at `crm.yoursystem.com`, any domain passing `*.yoursystem.com` will be considered as a valid redirect URI.

#### Example

HTML button to initiate Google Sign-In:
```html
<a href="http://crm.press/users/google/sign">Google Sign-In</a>
```

### Apple Sign-In

Users module supports Apple Sign-In authentication using the Authorization code flow and ID token.

#### Configuration

Any application that uses Apple Sign-In must have authorization credentials that identify the application to Apple.
For more information, please go to Apple [Get started page](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/get-started/).

After acquiring credentials, put them to `neon` configuration file using the following format:
```neon
users:
	sso:
	    apple:
	        client_id: CLIENT_ID # default client ID used for signing in on the web
	        trusted_client_ids: [CLIENT_ID] # other trusted client IDs using the Apple ID to sign in (e.g. mobile apps)
```

Last step is to **enable** Apple Sign-In in CRM settings in `/admin/config-admin/` Authentication section.

#### ID Token

ID Token is a Apple-signed JWT token holding user information.
This module provides an [API endpoint](#post-apiv1usersapple-token-sign-in) to validate the token and match it to an existing user (or create a new one) using user's email address.

#### Authorization code flow

Standard OAuth2 Authorization code flow is initiated when user is redirected to `http://crm.press/users/apple/sign` URL.

An optional parameter is `url`, which is a URL to redirect to after the successful login.
`url` is validated against current CRM domain - `url` has to share at least the second level domain, e.g. if your CRM is available at `crm.yoursystem.com`, any domain passing `*.yoursystem.com` will be considered as a valid redirect URI.

#### Example

HTML button to initiate Apple Sign-In:
```html
<a href="http://crm.press/users/apple/sign">Apple Sign-In</a>
```

### Allow domains in url redirect

To enable more domains in url redirect, please add the following configuration to your configuration `neon` file:

```neon
signInRedirectValidator:
    setup:
    	- addAllowedDomains('another.domain.com', 'some.other.domain.net')
```

## Data retention configuration

You can configure time before which `application:cleanup` deletes old repository data and column which it uses by using (in your project configuration file):

```neon
autoLoginTokensRepository:
	setup:
		- setRetentionThreshold('now', 'valid_at')
changePasswordsLogsRepository:
	setup:
		- setRetentionThreshold('-12 months')
userActionsLogRepository:
	setup:
		- setRetentionThreshold('-12 months')
```

## AccessTokenAuthenticator

UsersModule generates an access token for every successful user authentication. This token can be used to authenticate the user in API calls.

You can log the user into the CRM automatically if you have such token thanks to the [`AccessTokenAuthenticator`](src/Authenticator/AccessTokenAuthenticator.php).


### How to use

CRM checks if there's a cookie called `n_token` and extracts the value from it. If the value is valid access token (it's still present in the `access_tokens` table), and it doesn't belong to admin account, it logs user in automatically without requesting username or password.

This comes handy in case your login process is handled on other domain (e.g. in your CMS via CRM's API) and you want your users to get logged in only once.

## Events

### NewUserEvent

`NewUserEvent` is emitted for all types of new users created - both regular (claimed) and unclaimed.

### UserRegisteredEvent

`UserRegisteredEvent` is emitted when a regular user is created through `UserBuilder`. Unclaimed user is not considered to be a regular user.

If you call `UsersRepository::add` directly in your own extension and it's a regular user, make sure you emit `UserRegisteredEvent` at the end of the process.

### UserCreatedEvent

`UserCreatedEvent` used to be an event emitted during user registration. This is now deprecated. Use `UserRegisteredEvent` and possibly `NewUserEvent` instead.

## API documentation

All examples use `http://crm.press` as a base domain. Please change the host to the one you use
before executing the examples.

All examples use `XXX` as a default value for authorization token, please replace it with the
real tokens:

* *API tokens.* Standard API keys for server-server communication. It identifies the calling application as a whole.
They can be generated in CRM Admin (`/api/api-tokens-admin/`) and each API key has to be whitelisted to access
specific API endpoints. By default the API key has access to no endpoint.
* *User tokens.* Generated for each user during the login process, token identify single user when communicating between
different parts of the system. The token can be read:
    * From `n_token` cookie if the user was logged in via CRM.
    * From the response of [`/api/v1/users/login` endpoint](#post-apiv1userslogin) -
    you're free to store the response into your own cookie/local storage/session.

API responses can contain following HTTP codes:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 OK | Successful response, default value |
| 400 Bad Request | Invalid request (missing required parameters) |
| 403 Forbidden | The authorization failed (provided token was not valid) |
| 404 Not found | Referenced resource wasn't found |

If possible, the response includes `application/json` encoded payload with message explaining
the error further.

#### GET `/api/v1/user/info`

API call returns basic user information based on provided user token.

##### *Headers:*

| Name | Value | Required | Description |
| --- |---| --- | --- |
| Authorization | Bearer *String* | yes | User token. |


##### *Example:*

```shell
curl -v –X GET http://crm.press/api/v1/user/info \
-H "Content-Type:application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer XXX"
```

Response:

```json5
{
    "status": "ok",
    "user": {

        "first_name": "Test",
        "last_name": "Admin"
    }
}
```

This was a response from default `UserAuthenticator`. If your application use some custom implementation of authenticator
(e.g. `FooAuthenticator`), the authenticator can add extra parameters to the response:

```json5
{
    "status": "ok",
    "user": {
        // ...
