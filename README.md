# CRM Users Module

This documentation describes API handlers and CLI commands provided by this module for
others to use. It expects your application is based on the [CRM skeleton](https://github.com/remp2020/crm-skeleton)
provided by us.

## Installing module

We recommend using Composer for installation and update management.

```shell
composer require remp/crm-users-module
```

## Enabling module

Add installed extension to your `app/config/config.neon` file.

```neon
extensions:
	- Crm\UsersModule\DI\UsersModuleExtension
```

## AccessTokenAuthenticator

UsersModule generates an access token for every successful user authentication. This token can be used to authenticate the user in API calls.

You can log the user into the CRM automatically if you have such token thanks to the [`AccessTokenAuthenticator`](src/authenticator/AccessTokenAuthenticator.php).

### How to use

CRM checks if there's a cookie called `n_token` and extracts the value from it. If the value is valid access token (it's still present in the `access_tokens` table), and it doesn't belong to admin account, it logs user in automatically without requesting username or password.

This comes handy in case your login process is handled on other domain (e.g. in your CMS via CRM's API) and you want your users to get logged in only once.

## API documentation

All examples use `http://crm.press` as a base domain. Please change the host to the one you use
before executing the examples.

All examples use `XXX` as a default value for authorization token, please replace it with the
real tokens:

* *API tokens.* Standard API keys for server-server communication. It identifies the calling application as a whole.
They can be generated in CRM Admin (`/api/api-tokens-admin/`) and each API key has to be whitelisted to access
specific API endpoints. By default the API key has access to no endpoint. 
* *User tokens.* Generated for each user during the login process, token identify single user when communicating between
different parts of the system. The token can be read:
    * From `n_token` cookie if the user was logged in via CRM.
    * From the response of [`/api/v1/users/login` endpoint](https://github.com/remp2020/crm-users-module#post-apiv1userslogin) -
    you're free to store the response into your own cookie/local storage/session.

API responses can contain following HTTP codes:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 OK | Successful response, default value | 
| 400 Bad Request | Invalid request (missing required parameters) | 
| 403 Forbidden | The authorization failed (provided token was not valid) | 
| 404 Not found | Referenced resource wasn't found | 

If possible, the response includes `application/json` encoded payload with message explaining
the error further.

#### GET `/api/v1/user/info`

API call returns basic user information based on provided user token.

##### *Headers:*

| Name | Value | Required | Description |
| --- |---| --- | --- |
| Authorization | Bearer *String* | yes | User token. |


##### *Example:*

```shell
curl -v –X GET http://crm.press/api/v1/user/info \ 
-H "Content-Type:application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer XXX"
```

Response:

```json5
{
    "status": "ok",
    "user": {

        "first_name": "Test",
        "last_name": "Admin"
    }
}
```

This was a response from default `UserAuthenticator`. If your application use some custom implementation of authenticator
(e.g. `FooAuthenticator`), the authenticator can add extra parameters to the response:

```json5
{
    "status": "ok",
    "user": {
        // ...
